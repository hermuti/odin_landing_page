Key Flexbox Features Used Throughout:
display: flex - The fundamental property that enables flexbox
justify-content - For horizontal alignment (main axis)
align-items - For vertical alignment (cross axis)
gap - For consistent spacing between flex items
flex-direction - For controlling flow direction (row/column)
Implicit equal distribution - Using flex: 1 to make children share space equally
